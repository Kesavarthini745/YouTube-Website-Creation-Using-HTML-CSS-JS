# YouTube-Website-Creation-Using-HTML-CSS-JS
This project is a YouTube clone implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to recreate the basic functionality and design of the popular video-sharing platform YouTube.

The project uses the YouTube Data API to fetch and display videos, channels, and playlists. The project also has a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
To run this project, you need to have a Google API key that enables the YouTube Data API. You can get one from the [Google Developers Console]. You also need to have a web server that can serve static files. You can use any web server of your choice, such as Apache, Nginx, or Node.js.
Alternatively, you can use a live server extension for your code editor, such as [Live Server for VS Code].

To run this project, follow these steps:
1.Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.Open the youtube.html,youtube.css,youtube.js file in your code editor and replace the value of the API_KEY variable with your own Google API key.
3.Save the file and run it on your web server or live server.
4.Enjoy the YouTube clone website!
